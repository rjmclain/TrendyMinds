Important Notes:

While I try to be fairly versatile, I tried to go with somewhat less markup in the HTML, which creates more altering within 
the styling.  However, this was mostly to show what could be done, even though I realize often when it comes to making things more 
administrable within a CMS this may not always be the best choice, and the additional HTML markup wouldn't be a noticable enough 
difference in load time for it to be an issue.

Also I avoided using certain HTML5 based tags like the nav and footer simply because I've run into backwards compatibility
issues.  I know that only IE10+ was needed for support, but I still thought it better to be safe in this scenario and just use
ID's for them for now.

I generally prefer to use Sass, but have plenty of experience with LESS as well as just writing everything as plain CSS. I made sure to include all files pertaining to the styling either way.
